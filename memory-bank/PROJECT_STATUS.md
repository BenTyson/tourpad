**Test Results**: Successfully tested with `judah@judah.com` - payment processed, user activated, dashboard accessible

## 🚧 CRITICAL NEXT PRIORITY (Immediate Sprint)

### Complete Status-Based User Journey Implementation
**URGENT**: After payment testing, implement proper gating and routing for all user types

#### 📋 Defined User Flow (FINAL SPEC):

**HOSTS:**
1. Submit Application → `PENDING` → **Holding Page** 📄
2. Admin Approval → `ACTIVE` → **Full Dashboard** ✅
3. Admin Rejection → `REJECTED` → **Rejection Notice** ❌

**ARTISTS:**  
1. Submit Application → `PENDING` → **Holding Page** 📄
2. Admin Approval → `APPROVED` → **Payment Page** 💳 ($400/year)
3. Payment Complete → `ACTIVE` → **Full Dashboard** ✅
4. Admin Rejection → `REJECTED` → **Rejection Notice** ❌

**FANS:**
1. Registration → `PENDING` → **Fan Payment Page** 💳 ($10/month)
2. Payment Complete → `ACTIVE` → **Fan Dashboard** ✅

#### 🔧 Implementation Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY):

##### 1. Dashboard Routing System
- [ ] **Create holding page component** (`/components/dashboard/HoldingPage.tsx`)
- [ ] **Update dashboard routing** (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) with status-based conditionals
- [ ] **Add rejection page component** for declined applications
- [ ] **Test routing logic** for all user types and statuses

##### 2. Admin Approval Logic Updates  
- [ ] **Modify artist approval** to set status to `APPROVED` (not `ACTIVE`)
- [ ] **Keep host approval** setting status to `ACTIVE` (direct access)
- [ ] **Update approval API** (`/api/admin/applications/[userId]/approve/route.ts`)

##### 3. Payment Integration
- [ ] **Fan payment flow** ($10/month subscription)
- [ ] **Artist payment completion** → `ACTIVE` status handler
- [ ] **Payment verification** and status update webhooks
- [ ] **Separate pricing logic** (artists: $400/year, fans: $10/month)

##### 4. Data Mapping Confirmation
- [ ] **Application → Dashboard data flow**: Approved applications become starting point for profiles
- [ ] **Photo migration**: Application photos populate dashboard galleries
- [ ] **Profile completion**: Users continue building profiles after activation

## 📊 Current System State

### Database Status
- **Total Users**: 23 (9 artists, 9 hosts, 5 fans)
- **Pending Applications**: 6 (5 hosts including Dad Tyson + 1 artist Chad Michael)
- **Photo Storage**: Working - venue photos uploading to HostMedia table
- **Application Data**: Real submissions with all fields (additionalInfo, newToHosting)
- **File Serving**: `/api/files/[...path]/route.ts` serving images correctly

### Development Environment
- **Server**: Stable at localhost:3000 with memory optimization
- **TypeScript**: Clean compilation (major error fixes completed)
